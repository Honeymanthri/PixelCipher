# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

This project is a GUI-based Image Encryption tool built using Python and Tkinter, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images securely using a passcode.

## Features

- **Encrypt** images with a secure passcode.
- **Decrypt** images using the correct passcode.
- **User-friendly interface** with side-by-side encryption & decryption.
- **Passcode-based security** with hashing for verification.
- **Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.)**.

## How It Works

### Encryption

1. Select an image.
2. Enter a passcode for encryption.
3. The tool encrypts the image and saves it securely.

### Decryption

1. Select the encrypted image.
2. Enter the correct passcode.
3. The tool decrypts and displays the original image.
